This application simulates donuts sold per hour at each donut shop.
	For each shop for each hour, a random  integer is generated
	constrained by the maximum and minimum possible number of customers
	for each shop. The generated number of customers is mulitplied by
	the average number of donuts sold per customer at that shop.
	They are then displayed in the following table, then added together
	to calculate the total number of donuts sold.
