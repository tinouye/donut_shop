	<h1>Donut Shop Simulation</h1>
	<p>
	This application simulates donuts sold per hour at each donut shop. <br>
	For each shop for each hour, a random  integer is generated <br>
	constrained by the maximum and minimum possible number of customers <br>
	for each shop. The generated number of customers is mulitplied by <br>
	the average number of donuts sold per customer at that shop. <br>
	They are then displayed in the following table, then added together <br>
	to calculate the total number of donuts sold.
